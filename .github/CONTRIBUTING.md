## Contributing

We ðŸ’› contributions! The rules for contributing to this org are few:

1. Search issues before opening a new one
1. Lint and run tests locally before submitting a PR
1. Adhere to the code style the project has chosen
1. Fill in the required Issue and Pull Request sections

Unless your contribution _requires_ circumventing the rules below:

1. Don't commit `package-lock.json` or add that file to your PR.
1. Avoid committing Continuous Integration (CI) files, dotfiles, or rule files.
1. Avoid solutions which require experimental / harmony Node flags on Node versions supported by the project.
1. Avoid updating dependency versions.
